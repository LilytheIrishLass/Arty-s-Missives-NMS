            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings, champ! I am Art3mis, pronounced Are-tuh-miss (not Art-three-miss). I'm a fellow Traveller just
                like you most likely are. Explorer of worlds, discoverer of new species, creator of machines, destroyer
                of -kzzt- // 16 // 16 // 16 // 16 -kzzt-. I wear a dark purple and pink suit, and I always remain
                hooded. At least, all after the incident of -kzzt- on 4/6/24.</p>

            <h2>Freetime</h2>
            <p>Oh man, what do I do in my free time? I do a lot, honestly. Sometimes I'm exploring strange new worlds in
                the <em>Vonnegut II</em>, and sometimes I'm in the -kzzt- giving out free stuff to other
                Travellers-in-need! It's the most beautiful thing, seeing other Travellers be able to continue their
                journeys because of something you did. Brings a tear to my eye. Anyways, I also love smuggling black
                market goods between systems, but it's been a hot minute since I've been able to do that, sadly. Dang
                sentinels and system authorities always on my tail.</p>
