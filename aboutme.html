            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings, champ! I am Art3mis, pronounced Are-tuh-miss (not Art-three-miss). I'm a fellow Traveller just
                like you most likely are. Explorer of worlds, discoverer of new species, creator of machines, destroyer
                of -kzzt- // 16 // 16 // 16 // 16 -kzzt-. I wear a dark purple and pink exosuit, and I always remain
                hooded. At least, all after the incident of -kzzt- on 4/6/24.</p>

            <h2>Freetime</h2>
            <p>Oh man, what do I do in my free time? I do a lot, honestly. Sometimes I'm exploring strange new worlds in
                the <em>Vonnegut II</em>, and sometimes I'm in the -kzzt- giving out free stuff to other
                Travellers-in-need! It's the most beautiful thing, seeing other Travellers be able to continue their
                journeys because of something you did. Brings a tear to my eye. Anyways, I also love smuggling black
                market goods between systems, but it's been a hot minute since I've been able to do that, sadly. Damn
                sentinels and system authorities always on my tail.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>Hmm... my backstory. I know what you're thinking, "Ooh, I'd like to know more about this Art3mis person."
                Well guess what, Ace? So would I. You see, I kinda just.. popped in one day. One day, suddenly conscious.
                No idea where I came from, what I was doing. Just one day became aware that I was sailing through space
                in my "First" ship. I say first because I have no recollection of ANYTHING from before that. It was
                small. Small and red. White wings, red body, and it was decent. No idea where or how I got it though.
                But I've since parted with it. Didn't bond with it much... at least not that I remember. Now I'm the
                owner of two of my own ships. A solar sailor I found and patched up with a bit of elbow grease, and a
                -kzzt-. // ERROR // ERROR // { DATA CORRUPTED } // ERROR // ERROR // -kzzt- but I don't like to talk about that
                much... but anyways that's how I came to own the <em>Vonnegut II</em>.</p>
            <h2>Nutrition Facts</h2>
