            <h2>Log Entry #2 - Stardate 49::20024</h2>
            <p>I think I got it this time... you on yet? Oh, it appears so... I really need to install a light on this
                thing.<br><br>Anyways, I thought about my day-to-day life today, while exploring. Wondering how many
                others
                are out there, living my same exact lifestyle? If any, that is. I could be alone out here, in this
                infinite, desolate wasteland of stars, planets, systems, -kzzt-. Hmm... "out here". Isn't that funny?
                "Out here" usually implying there's a "back here"? Maybe there's some centralized area where everyone
                is, or where the Star-beings are, controlling me, watching me, laughing at me...<br>Maybe that's just
                me. I dunno, I'd love to hear others' input on that if I ever come across another wandering soul like
                me. And not those Vy'keen, Korvax, or Gek lunatics, no. They have their own goals in life, and no time
                for my philosophical thinking. <em>Sigh</em>, guess I truly am alone out here.<br><br>[ EMOTIONAL TRACES
                DETECTED, EXPUNGING FROM LOG ENTRY ]<br><br>I really hope that wasn't recorded...<br>
                Well, I came here to talk about one thing, and I have not even come close yet, in my infinite wisdom of
                letting my rambling take control of me. And here I go again. <em>Back. To. The. Point.
                    Art3mis.</em><br><br>
                My ship, the <em>Vonnegut II</em>, that is what I intended to document today.<br>I believed I've
                mentioned it a bit before, but never really shown much about it. Or described much about it, really.
                Well, I suppose I might as well let you all know about my daily life a bit... if there's anyone even
                reading this.

            <br>
            <p>I got Vonnie through a very long process that I don't really wish to talk about. Yeah, deal with it. I'll
                just mention it involved some sick flips, absolutely insane combat skills, and tremendous courage. All
                of which are required to have obtained Vonnie, of course. <em>Which is absolutely why I have her, thank
                    you very much!</em><br><br>

            <p>
                Jokes aside, those sentinels were pretty abnormal. Crystals protruding through their very shells, out
                from their innerworkings. I've never seen anything like these before. I'd like to investigate them a bit
                more sometime. I'd better make a note of that.
                <br><br>
                Now, back to Vonnie. What's she like, you may ask? She's very cool. Sick cockpit. Controls so incredibly
                comfortable in my hands, like I've been operating this starship since I began existing. Got an amazing
                built-in AI Commander. Literally, just ask it anything, and it'll respond. I've named Vonnie's AI
                Perseus. I've never heard anyone crack jokes better than that thing. I've never heard <em>anyone</em>
                ever crack jokes, for that matter...
                <br><br>
                Damn, I'm good at ruining the mood aren't I...<br>
                Guess that's just what happens when you're the only like-minded Traveler in possibly an infinite
                radius. Oh well, maybe someday I'll meet one of you loyal readers, and our brains will converge and
                we'll just go on and on for hours about theories and travels and philosophies...<br>
                <br>
                So about Vonnie,<br>
                she's uh, yellow.  and black.  yeah...<br>
                I need some time to myself

            <h2>Log Entry #1 - Stardate 48::20024</h2>
            <p>WORK YOU STUPID- Oh... Greetings, Traveler. I am Art3mis. This is my -kzzt- day on this planet I call
                <em>Incipio.</em> It's beautiful, really. Lush, reddish-purple grasses, and plenty of plantlife and
                lovely animals all over. Very mountainous in my region, however, but there's a nice lake nearby. Might
                go for a swim later, actually.<br><br>I'm currently recording this from my outpost, <em>Falco
                    Base.</em> It's small and quite underwhelming, but it's just what I need for the present. Nothing
                fancy, nothing drabby. Perhaps a little drabby... <em>Why would I reveal that? </em>I could say it's the
                most
                beautiful structure in Euclid, and you'd have no choice but to either believe or laugh at me. You
                can't see it, you're not here. Agh, I'm getting away from myself, I can be such a flibbertigibbet
                sometimes.
            </p>

            <label id="avLabl"><em>Incipio can be so beautiful at times...</em></label>
            <p>I mentioned Euclid above. You may not know what that is. If you're en experienced Traveler and find
                yourself asking this question, I'm sorry, but you're an idiot. If you're new, I'd love nothing more than
                to teach you. Euclid is what is widely accepted among Traveler-entities to be the galaxy we find
                ourselves in. This, however, implies that there must be more galaxies out there. Ha, I laugh at those
                who tell me this. Utter rubbish. Until I witness these <em>"other galaxies",</em> I have absolutely no
                reason whatsoever to believe there are others. I have no reason, in fact, to believe we are in a galaxy.
                Seeing as I've hardly ever encountered another Traveler, what's to say we aren't in a huge open space
                of planets, systems, and stars floating aimlessly? Sure, my ship and all entities I've spoken with talk
                of a galaxy centre, but I don't believe it. But I don't have time or care to find out either. There are
                strange new worlds out there that call me, that have mysteries for me. And I <em>will</em> find them.
                Make no mistake about that.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Well, it's getting dark and I'm finding it more and more difficult to resist the pull of fatigue on my
                eyelids. I best be heading off to rest for now. Who knows what wonders and horrors await me
                tomorrow.<br><br><br><em>Art3mis,<br> signing off...</em><br><br>[ DATA LOG CONCLUDED ]</p>
