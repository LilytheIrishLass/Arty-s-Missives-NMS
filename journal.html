            <h2>Log Entry #1 - Stardate 48::20024</h2>
            <p>WORK YOU STUPID- Oh... Greetings, Traveller. I am Art3mis. This is my -kzzt- day on this planet I call
                <em>Incipio.</em> It's beautiful, really. Lush, reddish-purple grasses, and plenty of plantlife and
                lovely animals all over. Very mountainous in my region, however, but there's a nice lake nearby. Might
                go for a swim later, actually.<br><br>I'm currently recording this from my outpost, <em>Falco
                    Base.</em> It's small and quite underwhelming, but it's just what I need for the present. Nothing
                fancy, nothing drabby. Perhaps a little drabby... <em>Why would I reveal that? </em>I could say it's the
                most
                beautiful structure in Euclid, and you'd have no choice but to either believe or laugh at me. You
                can't see it, you're not here. Agh, I'm getting away from myself, I can be such a flibbertigibbet
                sometimes.
            </p>

            <p>I mentioned Euclid above. You may not know what that is. If you're en experienced Traveller and find
                yourself asking this question, I'm sorry, but you're an idiot. If you're new, I'd love nothing more than
                to teach you. Euclid is what is widely accepted among Traveller-entities to be the galaxy we find
                ourselves in. This, however, implies that there must be more galaxies out there. Ha, I laugh at those
                who tell me this. Utter rubbish. Until I witness these <em>"other galaxies",</em> I have absolutely no
                reason whatsoever to believe there are others. I have no reason, in fact, to believe we are in a galaxy.
                Seeing as I've hardly ever encountered another Traveller, what's to say we aren't in a huge open space
                of planets, systems, and stars floating aimlessly? Sure, my ship and all entities I've spoken with talk
                of a galaxy centre, but I don't believe it. But I don't have time or care to find out either. There are
                strange new worlds out there that call me, that have mysteries for me. And I <em>will</em> find them.
                Make no mistake about that.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Well, it's getting dark and I'm finding it more and more difficult to resist the pull of fatigue on my
                eyelids. I best be heading off to rest for now. Who knows what wonders and horrors await me
                tomorrow.<br><br><br><em>Art3mis,<br> signing off...</em><br><br>[ DATA LOG CONCLUDED ]</p>
