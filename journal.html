                Greetings Traveler,
                <br><br>
                I am hungry.  Really hungry.<br><br>
                But luckily I scrounged up some extra materials and made a food-maker of sorts.  Not the best lookin' thing, but hey, give me a break, yeah?<br>
                I've been living on this planet for the past long while.  Plenty of plains, mountains, lakes, dunes, forests, the works.  And of course, plenty of fauna.  So life hasn't been too bad, but I just ran out of the stupid food packets they serve in the cafeteria on Parzy.<br>
                It's not bad, it's just, when that's all you've had to eat for the past however long you can remember, you want something more... exotic.<br><br>
                So that's why I built this thing here, this piece of junk.  Hell, I'll be lucky if I don't get a chunk of metal plating in my food.<br><br>Whatever.<br><br>
                I'm going to experiment with some of the different foods I've grown and harvested on this planet, the grains, herbs, meats, fruits, veggies...<br><br>
                If you don't hear from me again, something was probably toxic.  What a way to go out, huh?  Death from inedible object, after all I've been through.  At least the planet is pretty.

            <p>
                Greetings Traveler,
                <br><br>
                Well, I seem to be stranded.<br><br><br>
                I warped into a system, doin' my usual smuggling supply runs (that's right, sentinels.  Whatcha gonna do about it, huh?), and I saw some pirates picking on a Korvax freighter.  I sped my way over there, beat the pirates easy peasy, and made sure the crew was alright.  Their freighter was apparently named the S/V Heighliner.  They were transporting important cargo for nearby systems.  They carried 23 pods full of spices.  I know how potent that stuff is, so I let them on their way.
                <br><br>
                This system seemed pretty nice, honestly. A big, red and yellow watery planet, with some major continents under thick clouds.  A barren wasteland of a planet nearby, nothing attractive there.  And then another icey world, with temperatures apparently hundreds below 0?  I might have to recheck Vonnie's scanners once I get out of this predicament.
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>ANYWAYS,</em><br>
                Something happened, I got too close to the atmosphere of the big red and yellow planet apparently, and found myself tumbling end over end through the atmosphere.  Alarms blaring, beeping, yelling, every annoying sound you could hear, SCREAMING in my ears.  Pleasant.<br>
                I wondered at this point how long I had until I was dead.  Tumbling out of control, several thousand units down through the atmosphere of some giant.  If I was gonna die, at least it's in Vonnie.  With all I ever knew and loved, all that was ever close to me.<br><br>
                Then it came.  I felt a big thud, but surprisingly no metal screaming as it tore.  The ship was in one piece, but things felt a little wet.  Thankfully, we landed in a nice, beautiful, conveniently placed lake.  I tried to go about my business, and managed to force Vonnie's cockpit open.  A strange, beautiful world.  Not my favorite, but better than other places.<br>
                <br>
                <img class="postPic" src="images/stranded_image.png">
                <br>
                Just my luck, though, that I left my repair kits on <em>Parzival</em>.  And <em>Parzival</em> is 45 parsecs away right now, preoccupied with repairs and other maintenance for a month.  So I guess I'm stuck here, since Vonnie's engines are shot.  Whatever.  I'll see you then.

                Greetings Traveler,
                <br><br>
                I have returned.<br><br><br>
                I woke up this morning in a cold, very dark room. I couldn't see anything. I fumbled around for my
                helmet flashlight, only to find my arms weak. With great struggle, I managed to get the light on.<br><br>
                I was in a freighter logistical room.  Had I passed out on a derelict?  No... no I don't remember visiting one in a long while...<br>
                I stumbled across the room, and collapsed before the doorway.  I reached up just enough to hit the door switch.  Several seconds passed and nothing happened.<br><br>
                The door shook and creaked loudly, and then it slid op <span class="layers" id="corrupt">en to reveal a large monster. The dead crew. The rabbit <span class="redacted">████████</span>. I hobbled <span class="expunged">floor</span>. I fell <span class="error">[ERROR]</span> around the corner. I saw <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> room full and <span class="error">[DELETED]</span>. It creeped <span class="error">meow</span>. I managed to <span class="redacted">escape pod</span>. I ended up <span class="error">[ERROR]</span> Incipop.</span>
                <br><br><br>
                I stepped out of Vonnie, and reemerged back onto Incipio.  It has apparently been a long time.  I missed much while I was gone.  I shall never forget the crew of the SS Shagoyasi.  They saved my life, in return for <span id="superRedText">[THE CRIMSON EYE]</span>.

            <p>
                Greetings Traveler,
                <br><br>
                Things have been... lonely since I last logged. I've hardly seen the syntheti-gek. I feel so alone, with
                nowhere to go, no purpose, and no idea why I'm even here.
                <br><br>
                Why did the Atlas put me here? What is the point? Life is nothing without a direction. You give a
                creature a habitat without water, it'll die of dehydration. You give a creature a habitat without food,
                it'll starve to death. You give a creature a habitat without shelter, it'll get hunted. You give a
                creature a habitat with everything it needs, it'll die of boredom.
                <br><br>
                What else is there to do in this universe? The Vy'keen, the Korvax, the Gek... they're so content with
                their lives, happy. I never truly have felt that. I've never felt a sense of purpose. I just appeared
                one day.
                <br><br>
                What if that syntheti-gek wasn't another Traveller... and instead an anomaly, just like me? Maybe it's
                just like me, we don't belong in this universe. We were a mistake. We were brought here on accident, and
                left behind, forgotten. To live our life out only to discover there is nothing here for us. We explore,
                we find, we discover, we research... what? What are we discovering? <em>Why</em> are we discovering?

                Greetings Traveler,
                <br><br>
                Last night I had a dream... but this time it was rather nice. Not one of those repeating Gek-Worm
                nightmares that won't exit my damn brain. This one was peaceful...was nice...
                <br><br>
                I dreamt I was on this paradise planet, with purple grass, trees, atmosphere, nightly nebula, star, the
                likes. It was so beautiful, so peaceful, so relaxing. I ran and walked the forests and surface for
                kilometers, just exploring and taking it all in.
                <br><br>
                I came across this quaint little outpost. It was built just for me! Had all the things I like, and a
                nice cozy fire room to sit in when the nights got cold. A beautiful viewing area to watch the sun rise
                and set, with a beautiful ringed planet in the distance.
                <br><br>
                What do ya think the odds are that this planet might be real? Do I dare set out to find it? Or do I let
                my dreams consume me and only hope I can visit it again some night?

                Greetings Traveler,
                <br><br>
                Last night I had a horrid nightmare. I knew it was a nightmare from the start when I looked down and my
                hands were those of a Gek! A <strong>Gek!!!</strong><br>
                I then found myself on a nearly desolate world. No atmosphere, no plant life. Just these massive worms,
                constantly emerging and burrowing into the planet surface. Constant loud cries, sounding like those of a
                freighter alarm filled my helmet. I grabbed at my audio receptors, scrambling to power up the filter,
                only to find that I had no helmet, as I was a Gek.
                <br><br>
                <em>groan...</em>
                <br><br>
                I had a horrific multitool, with no modules or upgrades to it. Just a stock MT, bare bones as you can
                get. Damn thing overheated in a heartbeat. My exosuit was bare bones as well. Very small storage space.
                <br><br>
                I was clearly quite frustrated. The dream was so realistic, which is probably why I didn't think to
                simply "wake up". Oh well. But anyways, I figured maybe I'd still have Vonnie, so I set out to begin the
                search for her. What I found was not indeed Vonnie...
                <br><br>
                I apparently was the "proud" owner of this stupid, idiotic metal sausage of a ship. Hauler? Shuttle? I
                didn't care. The thing was ugly. That's when I noticed a faint beeping coming from my suit. I looked at
                the exoscreen on my wrist. I had a new message waiting.
                <br><br>
                I don't remember exactly what it read, but it was something along the lines of me needing to get off the
                planet and reach a specific system nearby. Simple enough.
                <br><br>
                Well, it <em>would</em> have been simple enough of my "ship" had a functioning warp drive, pulse drive,
                launch thrusters, warp cells... AGHHHH.
                <br><br>Fun.<br><br>
                Skip ahead, I got off planet, got to some other systems, nothing of note. Then suddenly this large
                metallic ball zipped in right in front of my ship in space. It was so fascinating, with spinning
                surfaces and different shapes etched into it. There was a ring of light in the front, seemingly an
                entrance. I flew my ship towards it, and I entered...
                <br><br>
                That's when I woke up.<br>
                What a funny dream.

                It has been a while since I've made a log. I've had lots to do lately, and spent much time with the
                syntheti-gek. Which is the reason for today's log. Today... I lost him in a sentinel fight. He fell
                right before me on the ground, motionless. I finished the sentinels off, but I could've easily avoided
                that, and that feeling is going to haunt me forever.
                <br><br>
                I don't know how much longer I can take, back in the lonely universe. This is hell. I can't do this.

            <p>
                Greetings,
                <br><br>
                It seems that I have come down with some serious space illness lately, and I've been forced to stay back
                on Incipio. As much as I wish to explore and travel the cosmos as usual, life had other plans. What a
                shame.
                <br><br>
                But I thought I'd take this time to explore a bit around my own home planet, Incipio. It's a beautiful
                place. Spring just came around, and all the plants and grass are turning from a dark purple into a nicer
                greenish colour. Hell, even the water changed colour. Isn't that something?
                <br><br>
                I've been going out on morning walks, and afternoon walks. The sunrises and sunsets are so pretty, the
                whole horizon shifts from a reddish orange to a blue. Incipio is isolated from most of the other planets
                in the system, so I get a very pretty view of the others in the night sky.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                As beautiful and calming as it is, it's just as lonely. Sure, I get the occasional trader flying by or
                landing, and doing a bit of negotiating, but... I feel more alone than ever.<br>I don't know, maybe I'm
                just sensitive. I was fine up until I met that syntheti-gek. I have theories.

                discovering, researching as much as I could. I came across this rather fascinating planet. The entire
                surface was a grassy prairie. I walked for miles and miles, just taking in all the beauty, the small
                lakes, the hills, the rocks, the beautiful fauna. I came across the perfect site...
                <br><br>
                Travelers and gentlemen, I present to you... Castle Art3mis!!<br><br>

                Sure, it may not look like much, or it may look like greatness. Who am I to tell you what your opinion
                should be? I am <em>Art3mis</em>, and I tell you that you should be AMAZED!
                <br>
                See? It worked, you love it, you dig it, you'd love to come visit it. Hey, that's a nice little jingle
                there...<br>
                I'm gonna go search for a portal now. I'll be back in a bit!

                Okay, I'm back. Only took about an hour and a half or so. I have the glyphs here! I've been warned
                though that these glyphs may be inaccurate if travelers are attempting to access them from <em>"another
                    galaxy."</em> HA, I simply laughed in their faces, it was so funny. The thought of there being other
                galaxies. Like, seriously? Come on, try harder next time. That joke wasn't even funny... okay well maybe
                it was really funny but still, it's a stupid and blind approach to the truth. There is no galaxy. We
                just "are." We exist, floating through space. Ridiculous.<br><br>
                And what the hell is a "Euclid?"

            <h2>Log Entry #8 [SETTLEMENT] - Stardate 41/9::20024</h2>
            <p>Got a settlement a bit ago, a little village you could say. About, oh I dunno, maybe 10-15
                inhabitants?<br>
                Anyways, they've been costing me money lately, about 300k units a day, and the debt is only getting
                worse... how wonderful. Thanks guys, truly appreciate ya.<br>
                Then I get this transmission while just going about my day. It's them, and apparently they're getting
                raided by sentinels?? Seriously guys????
                <br><br>
                I race back to their little hut-ville, fight relentless wave after wave of sentinels, never seeming to
                stop. They send in what looks like some big power suit type of thing, but robotic. Wasn't that
                difficult, really. I took it down in a matter of seconds. By the end of it, the grounds were absolutely
                buried under sentinel combat debris, it was terrible.
                <br><br>
                Anyways, just thought I'd log that. Maybe I should look into funding for some defense systems in this
                place, I think that'd be incredibly helpful for these.... stupid idiots... losers...

            <h2>Log Entry #7 [DERELICT] - Stardate 41/9::20024</h2>
            <p>Greetings.<br><br>
                I've been conducting a ton of in-depth research and experiments in <em>Desolate Drift II</em> lately,
                including investigating the many freighter wrecks that appear to be floating around the system. One such
                wreck is the <em>MS Nonjos</em>.<br><br>
                According to my findings, the freighter last visited and transported many biological entities to other
                systems for research. The entities on board, presumably escaped and killed all crew. Now, the entire
                freighter is crawling with these monstrous horrors. Nests everywhere, sticky goo lining the walls,
                floor, and ceiling. It's not recoverable. This wreck is to spend the rest of its days floating through
                deep space, serving as a new home to its horrific inhabitants.
                <br><br>
                But what I'm really excited to tell you all about, and show you, is something I thought I'd try, and I'm
                not sure how well it's going to work. Helmet cam footage. I recorded the entire expedition into the
                freighter, and saved it in my exosuit log disk. I'll grab a clip of that for ya real quick, and slap it
                down here. Hopefully this works!

            <p>Hey everyone!<br>Art3mis here<br><br>
                A lot has been going on recently, with new research priorities, new opportunities with said research,
                fixing up <em>Parzival</em>, the works. But I wanted to make sure I didn't leave you all in the dark or
                neglect this. So here I am, just a little update on how I'm doing and what's going on.<br>
                I plan to do some more freighter research in the next few days in <em>Desolate Drift II</em>, and
                hopefully uncover some more about the history of that place. There's a particular wreck I have in mind
                which I'm going to visit later today. If I can, I might record and upload some helmet cam footage. We'll
                see.<br><br>
                Speaking of freighters and <em>Parzival</em>, I should go a bit more into how I've renovated her
                interior. Now she's got a ton more science and research units, staff, lounge area, meeting hall,
                bio-rooms, you name it. <em>OAS Parzival</em>, combat-capable multi-purpose carrier research and
                exploration vessel. I like the ring of it.

            <p>Good mother of the Star-beings, look at this place! I came across it in my travels, and I've been in love
                ever since. Beautiful landscapes, views, skies, animals, everything you could want!
                <br>
                I've decided once I leave or shift my focus from Incipio more, I'm going to set up camp here, or at
                least set up a research outpost. This is too amazing of a place to simply pass up.

            <h2>Log Entry #4 [PIRATE] - Stardate 41/2::20024</h2>
            <p>I'm gonna start this off by saying I feel badass. I know, I'm most likely not the only one, now that I
                know I'm not alone, but still, let a girl feel proud, eh?<br>
                <br>
                Anyways, here's why. I got myself a sick new freighter. Well not new, I didn't have one before. But now
                I do, and it's sure to keep all guns pointed away from me. I seized it from the local pirate gang, while
                holding them at gunpoint. I warped in for a routine grocery trade run, and saw them bombarding a
                civilian freighter, which I simply couldn't allow.
                <br><br>
                I immediately zipped in, took out all their shield generators, <em>bang bang bang bang</em> and then
                zipped around to their rear end and banged th- um, destroyed their warp units. No possible chance of
                escape, Mr. <em>Piratee</em>. Hahaha!
                <br>
                <br>
                Once I finally brought down all the main battery, I boarded it, ran up to the bridge, and held my staff
                to the Pilot's scaley Gek throat, and demanded control. He absolutely agreed, what a kind gentleman. I
                promptly, thereaftore, told him to "Get the Hell off my Ship", as I was now the proud owner of a brand
                spankin' new dreadnought. Yeah yeah, no need to clap, I know I'm awesome.

            <h2>Log Entry #3 [IMPOSSIBLE] - Stardate 41/0::20024</h2>
            <p>I... I never thought this was possible.
                <br><br>
                I never thought other Travelers actually could possibly exist, as other than a figment of my
                imagination, my mind.
                <br><br>
                I met another Traveler today. He was Gek, but not fully. He looked robotic, but not Korvax.<br>Picture a
                Korvax, with all their appearance plating removed, just the wires and circuits exposed. That's what this
                Gek looked like. It made me uneasy.
                <br><br>
                I received this strange, garbled transmission last night while preparing for sleep. It was repeating,
                and when I deciphered it, I was presented glyphs, to a distant system. Naturally, I traveled to the
                nearest portal and input the glyphs. To my surprise, the portal accepted them and opened before me. My
                heart started racing, I had so many thoughts swirling around in my mind.<br><br>
                <em>Was this real? Was I dreaming? Is this just Perseus playing a prank on me? Am I about to meet
                    another like-minded entity?</em>
                I mustered up enough courage and walked into the portal.
                <br><br>
                Where I emerged was a desolate, thin-atmosphered planet. It was scattered with plants I've never seen
                before. The sky was empty, save for the stars and 2 other planets. That's when I noticed the Traveler in
                the distance, slowly making his way towards me.
                <br><br>
                He was hunched over, and leaned heavily on his staff. He appeared to be old, and an experienced
                Traveler. There was a complete lack of any normal Gek emotions in this Traveler. No excitement, no
                greed, no deception. Just pure, curiosity and... a look as if they expected me to arrive.
                <br><br>
                The Traveler spoke, giving me their name in a robotic tone. They spoke in Gek though, no surprise there.
                They called themselves <em>-kzzt-</em>.
                <br>
                We spent the next while talking, discovering more about the other, about our experiences, where we're
                from, our ideas, our way of life. It was revealed to me that he had discovered this system long ago, and
                he's found it so fascinating. Every pulse warp he made between planets, he'd encountered at least 2
                abandoned freighters. This intrigued me.
                <br>
                What would have to happen in a system to cause devastation on a scale like this? He explained that the
                system was completely abandoned and devoid of nearly any and all life, aside from plantlife. And even
                still, there were hardly any plants. And those that were found, had grown large, and fast, and quickly
                taken over the planets they inhabited.

            <label id="shipLabel1"><em>Me and -kzzt-</em></label>
            <br>
            <h2>The Deal</h2>
            <p>
                He made a deal with me. Growing and selling nip nip plants was his main goal, and I told
                him I'd supply him with anything he needed, and export his products in return for a research license to
                the system. I could tell he considered every point of view to this, and everything that could be a
                loop hole or way around it. I knew he didn't want the sentinels or Galactic Authority anywhere near this
                system.
                <br><br>
                After several, long minutes, he accepted my deal. A true Gek, I knew he could never turn down a deal.
                <br><br>
                Now, I've set up the grounds for a research outpost on his specified nip nip planet. I think it might be
                a good idea to create a research panel here in my logbook, to document my findings. We'll see. Time will
                tell what will
                happen. All of this was so unexpected, it just hit suddenly and hard. If you're reading this, wish me
                luck on whatever happens next. Now I know more Travelers exist. Please, if you're reading this. Let me
                know you're out there if you can. Everything means so much more to me now.

                of which are required to have obtained Vonnie, of course. <em>Which is absolutely why I have her, thank

                Jokes aside, those sentinels were pretty abnormal. Crystals protruding through their very shells, out
                from their innerworkings. I've never seen anything like these before. I'd like to investigate them a bit
                more sometime. I'd better make a note of that.

                built-in AI Commander. Literally, just ask it anything, and it'll respond. I've named Vonnie's AI
                Perseus. I've never heard anyone crack jokes better than that thing. I've never heard <em>anyone</em>

                Guess that's just what happens when you're the only like-minded Traveler in possibly an infinite
                radius. Oh well, maybe someday I'll meet one of you loyal readers, and our brains will converge and
                we'll just go on and on for hours about theories and travels and philosophies...<br>
                <br>
                So about Vonnie,<br>
                she's uh, yellow. and black. yeah...<br>
                I need some time to myself

            <h2>Log Entry #1 [BEGINNINGS] - Stardate 48::20024</h2>
            <p>WORK YOU STUPID- Oh... Greetings, Traveler. I am Art3mis. This is my -kzzt- day on this planet I call
                <em>Incipio.</em> It's beautiful, really. Lush, reddish-purple grasses, and plenty of plantlife and
                lovely animals all over. Very mountainous in my region, however, but there's a nice lake nearby. Might
                go for a swim later, actually.<br><br>I'm currently recording this from my outpost, <em>Falco
                    Base.</em> It's small and quite underwhelming, but it's just what I need for the present. Nothing
                fancy, nothing drabby. Perhaps a little drabby... <em>Why would I reveal that? </em>I could say it's the
                most
                beautiful structure in Euclid, and you'd have no choice but to either believe or laugh at me. You
                can't see it, you're not here. Agh, I'm getting away from myself, I can be such a flibbertigibbet
                sometimes.

            <p>I mentioned Euclid above. You may not know what that is. If you're en experienced Traveler and find
                yourself asking this question, I'm sorry, but you're an idiot. If you're new, I'd love nothing more than
                to teach you. Euclid is what is widely accepted among Traveler-entities to be the galaxy we find
                ourselves in. This, however, implies that there must be more galaxies out there. Ha, I laugh at those
                who tell me this. Utter rubbish. Until I witness these <em>"other galaxies",</em> I have absolutely no
                reason whatsoever to believe there are others. I have no reason, in fact, to believe we are in a galaxy.
                Seeing as I've hardly ever encountered another Traveler, what's to say we aren't in a huge open space
                of planets, systems, and stars floating aimlessly? Sure, my ship and all entities I've spoken with talk
                of a galaxy centre, but I don't believe it. But I don't have time or care to find out either. There are
                strange new worlds out there that call me, that have mysteries for me. And I <em>will</em> find them.
                Make no mistake about that.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Well, it's getting dark and I'm finding it more and more difficult to resist the pull of fatigue on my
                eyelids. I best be heading off to rest for now. Who knows what wonders and horrors await me
                tomorrow.<br><br><br><em>Art3mis,<br> signing off...</em><br><br>[ DATA LOG CONCLUDED ]</p>
